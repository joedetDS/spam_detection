# Spam Detection using Machine Learning

This repository contains the code for a spam detection system using machine learning techniques. The dataset has been processed and cleaned, and the best performing model, SVC, has been selected based on its accuracy and time complexity.

## Overview

The goal of this project was to create an effective spam detection system using machine learning. After extensive data preprocessing and model evaluation, the Support Vector Classifier (SVC) was chosen for its accuracy and efficiency.

## Project Details

- **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset underwent extensive cleaning and preprocessing to ensure optimal model performance.
- **Best Model:** The SVC model was selected as the best-performing model based on accuracy and time complexity.
- **Included Files:** This repository includes the vectorizer and the trained SVC model for future use.

## Getting Started

To use this model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Use the provided vectorizer and model for your own spam detection tasks.
